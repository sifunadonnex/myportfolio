#### A clean, beautiful and responsive portfolio!

This is an easy-to-customize personal portfolio template that was created with Next JS. It is a lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the p grid system and loaded with Font Awesome. Alternatively, you can edit styles, colors, and scripts fairly easily.

# 🤟If you like it

You can clone or fork this repo as a theme for your portfolio site. Because it doesn't use any plugins, you can easily host it on GitHub Pages. Even so, I recommend cloning your fork locally to create and preview your posts, regardless of where you choose to publish.

# ♲Using the Template

- Fork and Clone the repository

```
https://sifunaportfolio.vercel.app/
```

- Go inside the main repository

```
$ cd myportfolio
```

- Modify all relevant files to change the names and links to point at your pages.

- Deploy freely to Vercel or Netlify
